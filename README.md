## Building and Running the Program on Hopper
To perform this work, you will have to:
1.  Log into `hopper.winthrop.edu` from your laptop using `ssh` or `PuTTy`
2.  Clone the project onto hopper using `git clone` *project URL*
3.  Change into the project directory: `cd ` *project directory name*
4.  Building using `make`
5.  Run by typing the name of the executable:  `lab3-main.exe`


## How and What to Submit
Submission will happen via this GitHub respository.  So you'll need to make sure you *add* all necessary files , and you will also need to make sure your code is committed and pushed to GitHub *before* the submission due date.  When you are ready for me to grade, please *also* submit something in the BlackBoard assignment to indicate that you are done so I know which commit to grade.

Here are the files that should be present in your repository:
* Your C++ source files
* A `Makefile` that builds your program

**Do not** include object files or your binary executable in the repository.
